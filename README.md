PEA Extends APE - a few function definitions to make it
easier to work with time trees in APE.

To install, download the source
[tarball](https://github.com/tgvaughan/PEA/archive/master.tar.gz),
then run `R CMD INSTALL PEA-master.tar.gz` from the command line
within the directory containing that tarball. The package will then be
available for loading using `library(pea)` within R.
